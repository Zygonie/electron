It enables live development with Electron (similar to `ember serve`) as well as testing in Electron (similar to `ember test` and `ember test --server`). It also comes with an integrated packager, turning your Ember App into standalone binaries for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. It also integrates the famous Ember Inspector. The commands are:\n\n* `ember electron` - Run app in Electron with live-reload server\n* `ember electron:test` - Test the app using Electron\n* `ember electron:test --server` - Test with Electron in development server mode\n* `ember electron:package` - Create binaries (.app, .exe, etc) for your app\n\nEmber-Electron builds on prior work done by @brzpegasus (author of [`ember-cli-nwjs`](https://github.com/brzpegasus/ember-cli-nwjs)) and @joostdevries (author of [`ember-cli-remote-inspector`](https://github.com/joostdevries/ember-cli-remote-inspector)).\n\nTo see a real world example, check out [Ghost Desktop](https://github.com/tryghost/Ghost-Desktop).\n\n## Installation and Usage\nTo install the addon, run:\n```\nember install ember-electron\n```\n\nOr, to install with npm - but please ensure (:warning:) that the blueprint generation runs - it creates necessary files and configuration for this addon to work. Please ensure that your `tests` folder contains a `package.json` and a `electron.js` - and that `locationType` in `config/environment.js` is set to `hash`.\n```\nnpm install ember-electron\nember g ember-electron\n```\n\nOnce you installed the addon, you'll notice that a new file called `electron.js` was created in the root folder of your application. This is the entry point for Electron and is responsible for creating browser windows and other interactions with Electron APIs.\n\n### Configuration and First Use\nTo run your app together with a file watcher in development mode (similar to `ember serve`), you can run  `ember electron`. However, you will need to change your configuration for Ember and Electron to work well together: Electron does not support the History API. Therefore Ember-Cli must be configured to use the `hash` location type. Update your `config/environment.js`'s `locationType` config option to `hash`. If you would like to support running the app both within and outside of Electron you can use the following switch:\n\n```js\n  locationType: process.env.EMBER_CLI_ELECTRON ? 'hash' : 'auto',\n```\n\n## Ember Inspector\nIf you're running a later version of Electron, you will notice that ember-electron installs ember-inspector directly into Electron. Simply open up the developer tools and choose the Ember-tab, just like you would in Chrome. \n\nIn addition, Whenever you run `ember electron`, the console output will give you a URL where Ember Inspector is live. Communication between your app in Electron and the Ember Inspector happens over WebSockets. By default, the console output should look like this:\n\n```\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nEmber Inspector running on http://localhost:30820\nOpen the inspector URL in a browser to debug the app!\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nStarting Electron...\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n```\n\n## Testing\nTo test your app, run `ember electron:test`. If you prefer the live-reload mode, run `ember electron:test --server`. The usual parameters are supported:\n\n* `--server` - Run tests in interactive mode (default: false)\n* `--protocol` - 'The protocol to use when running with --server (default: 'http')\n* `--host` - The host to use when running with --server (default: 'localhost')\n* `--port` - The port to use when running with --server (default: 7357)\n* `--module` - The name of a test module to run\n* `--filter` - A string to filter tests to run\n\n## Packaging\nEmber-Electron comes with an integrated packager to create binaries (.app, .exe etc), which can be run with `ember electron:package`. By default, the packager creates binaries for all platforms and architectures using your app's name and version as defined in `package.json`. Under the hood, it uses the popular [electron-packager](https://github.com/maxogden/electron-packager) module.\n\nTo create standalone binaries of your Ember App, simply run the following command.\n```\nember electron:package\n```\n\n### Defining Files to Package\nBy default, ember-electron will package your whole `dist` folder and all production dependencies as defined in `package.json`. In addition, to ensure that Electron can start properly, it also includes `electron.js` and `package.json`. To configure which files make it into the package, use the `copy-files` property the ember-electron section in your `package.json`. Globs are accepted!\n\n```json\n\"ember-electron\": {\n  \"copy-files\": [\n    \"package.json\",\n    \"electron.js\"\n    \"main/*\"\n  ],\n}\n```\n\n### Configuration\nYou can pass options to the packager by either putting configuration into your app's `package.json`, or by passing a command line parameter to the `ember electron:package` command. You can extend your existing `package.json` with all available configuration options by running `ember generate ember-electron`. In the case that an option is defined both on the command line and in the package.json, the command line option will be used.\n\n* `--dir` - *String* The source directory\n* `--name` - *String* The application name.\n* `--platform` - *String* Allowed values: *linux, win32, darwin, mas, all*\n* `--arch` - *String* Allowed values: *ia32, x64, all*\n* `--version` - *String* Electron version (without the 'v') - for example, [`0.33.9`](https://github.com/atom/electron/releases/tag/v0.33.9), see [Electron releases](https://github.com/atom/electron/releases) for valid versions\n* `--app-copyright` - *String* The human-readable copyright line for the app. Maps to the LegalCopyright metadata property on Windows, and NSHumanReadableCopyright on OS X.\n* `--app-bundle-id` - *String* The bundle identifier to use in the application's plist (OS X only)\n* `--app-category-type` - *String* The application category type, as shown in the Finder via *View -> Arrange by Application Category* when viewing the Applications directory (OS X only). For example, `app-category-type=public.app-category.developer-tools` will set the application category to *Developer Tools*. Valid values are listed in [Apple's documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/LaunchServicesKeys.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009250-SW8).\n* `--app-version` - *String* The release version of the application. Maps to the `ProductVersion` metadata property on Windows, and `CFBundleShortVersionString` on OS X.\n* `--asar` - *Boolean* Whether to package the application's source code into an archive, using [Electron's archive format](https://github.com/atom/asar). Reasons why you may want to enable this feature are described in [an application packaging tutorial in Electron's documentation](http://electron.atom.io/docs/v0.36.0/tutorial/application-packaging/). Defaults to `false`.\n\n  - `ordering` - *String*: A path to an ordering file for packing files. An explanation can be found on the [Atom issue tracker](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/10163).\n  - `unpack` - *String*: A [glob expression](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch#features), when specified, unpacks the file with matching names to the `app.asar.unpacked` directory.\n  - `unpackDir` - *String*: Unpacks the dir to the `app.asar.unpacked` directory whose names exactly or pattern match this string. The `asar.unpackDir` is relative to `dir`.\n\n  For example, `asar-unpack-dir=sub_dir` will unpack the directory `/<dir>/sub_dir`.\n* `--build-version` - *String* The build version of the application. Maps to the `FileVersion` metadata property on Windows, and `CFBundleVersion` on OS X.\n* `--copy-dev-modules` - *Boolean* Copy dependency node modules from local dev node_modules instead of installing them.\n* `--download` - *Object* If present, passes custom options to [`electron-download`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-download)\n(see the link for more detailed option descriptions and the defaults).\n\n  - `cache` *String*: The directory where prebuilt, pre-packaged Electron downloads are cached.\n  - `mirror` *String*: The URL to override the default Electron download location.\n  - `strictSSL` *Boolean*: Whether SSL certificates are required to be valid when downloading Electron.\n\n* `--extend-info` - *String* Filename of a plist file; the contents are added to the app's plist. Entries in `extend-info` override entries in the base plist file supplied by electron-prebuilt, but are overridden by other explicit arguments such as `app-version` or `app-bundle-id`.\n* `--extra-resource` - *String* Filename of a file to be copied directly into the app's Contents/Resources directory.\n* `--helper-bundle-id` - *String* The bundle identifier to use in the application helper's plist (OS X only).\n* `--icon` - *String* Currently you must look for conversion tools in order to supply an icon in the format required by the platform. If the file extension is omitted, it is auto-completed to the correct extension based on the platform.\n\n  - OS X: `.icns`\n  - Windows: `.ico` ([See below](#building-windows-apps-from-non-windows-platforms) for details on non-Windows platforms)\n  - Linux: this option is not required, as the dock/window list icon is set via [the icon option in the BrowserWindow contructor](http://electron.atom.io/docs/v0.30.0/api/browser-window/#new-browserwindow-options). Setting the icon in the file manager is not currently supported.\n\n* `--ignore` - *RegExp* A pattern which specifies which files to ignore when copying files to create the package(s). Take note that Ember Electron creates a temp folder containing `electron.js`, `package.json`, and Ember Cli's `dist` output folder.\n* `--out` - *String* The directory where electron builds are saved. Defaults to `electron-builds/`.\n* `--overwrite` - *Boolean* Whether to replace an already existing output directory for a given platform (`true`) or skip recreating it (`false`).

However, because Chromium requires a display to work, you will need to create a fake display during your test in a headless environment like Travis CI or Circle CI. This addon automatically configures `.travis.yml`, but if you'd like to configure it manually, ensure that you take the following steps:\n\n * Install [`xvfb`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xvfb). It's a virtual framebuffer, implementing the X11 display server protocol - it performs all graphical operations in memory without showing any screen output, which is exactly what we need. A [Jenkins addon is available](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Xvfb+Plugin).\n * Create a virtual `xvfb` screen and export an environment variable called `DISPLAY` that points to it. Electron will automatically pick it up.\n * Install a recent C++ compiler (e.g. gcc). This is to enable the CI server to build native modules for Node.js.\n * Finally, ensure that `npm test` actually calls `ember electron:test`. You can configure what command `npm test executes` by changing it in your `package.json`.\n\nOn Travis, the configuration should look like this:\n\n```\nenv:\n  - CXX=g++-4.8\n\naddons:\n  apt:\n    sources:\n      - ubuntu-toolchain-r-test\n    packages:\n      - xvfb\n      - g++-4.8\n\nbefore_install:\n  - \"npm config set spin false\"\n\ninstall:\n  - npm install -g bower\n  - npm install\n  - bower install\n  - export DISPLAY=':99.0'\n  - Xvfb :99 -screen 0 1024x768x24 > /dev/null 2>&1 &\n```\n\n## Conflict between Ember and Electron: require()\nBoth Ember Cli and Node.js use `require()`. Without ember-electron, Ember will start and overwrite Node's `require()` method, meaning that you're stuck without crucial tools such as `require('electron')`.\n\nWhen using ember-electron, this conflict is automatically managed for you - you can continue to use Ember's `require()` for Ember Cli modules, but also use `requireNode()` for Node modules. The same is true for `window.module` (which is available as `window.moduleNode`) and `window.process` (which is available as `window.processNode`).\n\nIn addition, the `require()` method is overwritten to resolve both AMD and Node modules (see below) - however, to maintain code sanity, I recommend using `require()` and `requireNode()`.\n\n## Creating Installers\nEmber-Electron does currently not create installers for you, but plenty of modules exist to automate this task. For Windows installers, GitHub's very own [grunt-electron-installer](https://github.com/atom/grunt-electron-installer) does a great job. On OS X, you probably want to create a pretty DMG image - [node-appdmg](https://github.com/LinusU/node-appdmg) is a great command line tool to create images. If you'd like to follow GitHub's lead and stick with Grunt, consider [grunt-appdmg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-appdmg)\n\n# License & Credits\nMIT - (C) Copyright 2015 Felix Rieseberg.
